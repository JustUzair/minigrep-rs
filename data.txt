The Morning Light

In the garden, where the roses bloom and dance,
The morning light breaks through the misty air.
Golden rays illuminate every glance,
As nature wakes from sleep without a care.

The birds sing songs of joy among the trees,
The morning light illuminates their flight.
A gentle breeze carries the sweetest breeze,
Through flowers painted in the soft sunlight.

The dew still glistens on the tender leaves,
Each droplet sparkles like a precious gem.
The morning brings all that the heart believes,
A fresh beginning, nature's precious stem.

The world awakens slowly, piece by piece,
The morning light brings harmony and peace.
The trees stretch out their branches with such grace,
The morning starts another glorious race.

In meadows wild, the morning light arrives,
Where creatures great and small begin their days.
The light sustains all of our earthly lives,
And fills the world with bright and golden rays.

So cherish every moment that you see,
The morning light that sets your spirit free.
For in this light, we find our energy,
And wake to all that we can come to be.
